This is a wallpaper generator project. Currently it will generate a pixelated version of the mandlebrot fractal. 
It is quite slow because it does not take advantage of image processing and instead has a rather awkward high level work around.
The next build will hopefully use a faster way to generate the set as well as a way to save the image.
