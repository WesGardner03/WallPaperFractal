This is an archived version of a wallpaper generator project. It will generate a pixelated version of the mandlebrot fractal. 
It has been retired because it is quite slow due to the API it uses (java swing), making it impractical to generate high resolution backgrounds.
In the future there will (hopefully) be a faster, more robust version of this. This is more for memory's/ archival's sake.
